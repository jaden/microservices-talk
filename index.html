					# Microservices

					3 March 2017

					Dan Hersam

					Note:
					I'm not an expert, just read a few books and this is what I learned.
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## But first, a short interlude...
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>

					Note:
						Gives a view of how a technology or application will evolve over time.
						Technology Trigger
						Peak of Inflated Expectations
						Trough of Disillusionment
						Slope of Enlightenment
						Plateau of Productivity

					## What Are Microservices?
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					> An independently deployable component of bounded scope that supports interoperability through message-based communication.

					-- Irakli Nadareishvili
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					> Loosely coupled service-oriented architecture with bounded contexts.

					-- Adrian Cockcroft, Battery Ventures
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					> Small, autonomous services that work together.

 					-- Sam Newman, Thoughtworks
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## How To Recognize One in the Wild

					![](images/in_the_wild.gif)

				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Does One Thing Well

					(Single Responsibility Principle)

					Note:
					Small and Focused - Specialized. Separate business units
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Autonomous

					Note:
					Must be decoupled from other services and isolated - decentralized, Replaceability
					Golden rule: can you make a change to a service and deploy it by itself without changing anything else?
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Elastic

					Note:
					Scale appropriately depending on the usage
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Resilient

					Note:
					Fault-tolerant and provide a reasonable recovery timeframe if something goes wrong.
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Decentralized

					Note:
					Data too - no need for one massive database
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Microservices

					![](images/roundabout.jpg)

					Note:
					Separate business units. Startup, one employee = many hats.
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## ... vs a Monolith

					![](images/train.jpg)

					Note:
					Large company = employees = one job. Don't know how the tracks fit the analogy
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Best Practices?

					Still Evolving...

				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Why Use Microservices?
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Common Problems with Monoliths

					* Technical debt
					* Fear to change
					* Tightly-coupled
					* Lack of ownership
					* Hard to scale out
					* All or nothing deployment
					* Code complexity and maintainability

					Note:
					Explain each one on this slide
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Key Benefits of Microservices

					* Scaling
					* Resilience
					* Composable
					* Evolutionary
					* Ease of Deployment
					* Choose Your Technology
					* Organizational Alignment
					* Increased Development Speed

					Note:
					Briefly - following slides in more detail
				</section>

			  <section data-markdown>
					## Scaling

					![](images/monster-tricycle.jpg)
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Resilience</h2>

					<img src="images/christmas-lights.jpg" class="limit-height">

					<aside class="notes">
						Insulates individual services from one another
					</aside>
				</section>

			  <section data-markdown>
					## Composable

					![](images/legos-legot.jpg)

					Note:
					Flexible - put together for different purposes
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Evolutionary

					![](images/evolution.jpg)
				</section>

			  <section data-markdown>
					## Ease of Deployment

					![](images/indy-deployment.gif)
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Choose Your Technology</h2>

					<img src="images/supercomputer_cyoa_large.jpeg" class="limit-height">

					<aside class="notes">
					Right tool for the job, and easy to try out latest technologies
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Organizational Alignment

					![](images/Too_Many_Cooks.png)

					Note:
					Reduce the number of people working on a single codebase. Great for distributed teams
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>...The Two Pizza Rule</h2>

					<img src="images/two-pizzas.jpg" class="limit-height">

					<aside class="notes">
						How to size teams? (Often credited to Jeff Bezos) If a team can't be fed by two pizzas, it's too big.
						Seems odd to make teams based on how much they can eat, but it's a start.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Increased Development Speed

					![](images/faster.gif)
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Ready For Production?

					* Uber
					* Amazon
					* Netflix
					* Spotify
					* SoundCloud

				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					# BUT...
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
				  ## Not A Silver Bullet

			  </section>

			  <section>
			  	<!-- For some reason the list turns into a code block with markdown -->
			    <h2>New Common Problems</h2>

					<ul>
				    <li>Traceability</li>
				    <li>Network Latency</li>
				    <li>Message Routing</li>
				    <li>Service Discovery</li>
						<li>Operations Overhead</li>
				    <li>Eventual Consistency</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						Authentication, increased operational complexity, eventual consistency
						Developers must implement the interservice communication mechanism.
					</aside>
			  </section>

					## What About SOA?

					Note:
					Service Oriented Architecture at its heart is a very sensible idea - modularity and message-based communication. However much of the conventional wisdom around SOA doesnâ€™t help you understand how to split something big into something small. SOA - shared domain models, Microservices - distributed.
					Enterprise Service Bus vs HTTP
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## What About Decomposition?

					* Requires Same Technology
					* Lose Scaling Independently
					* Lose Independent Deployment
					* Less Resiliency

					Note:
					E.g. Modules or Shared Libraries
					Many of the advantages of a microservice-based architecture come from its granular nature and the fact that it gives you many more choices for solving problems. Can similar decompositional techniques achieve the same benefits?
					Technically, it should be possible to create well-factored, independent modules within a single monolithic process. And yet this rarely happens. The modules themselves soon become tightly coupled with the rest of the code, surrendering one of their key benefits. Having a process boundary separation does enforce clean hygiene in this respect (or at least makes it harder to do the wrong thing)

					## Should You Start Using Microservices?

				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Conway's Law

					> Any organization that designs a system will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure.

					-- Mel Conway

				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
				  ## Questions to Ask

				  * How big are the teams?
				  * What skills do they have?
				  * How are development and operations divided?
				  * How are responsibilities divided between teams?
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Other Considerations...
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Sufficiently Large Project

					Note:
					Microservices are ideal for big systems
					Warrants complexity of microservices (they don't come for free)
					Large, distributed team
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Focused on replaceability

					Note:
					Microservices can allow you to be more flexible and swap out components that aren't working well
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Deep Understanding of Problem Domain

					Note:
					One needs to know the problem domain very well before being able to correctly break it down into subdomains small
enough constitute functionalities for microservices.
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Second Version of Existing System

					Note:
					Ideal scenario
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## How To Introduce Change?

					> Find small changes that can unfold in a way that creates large
					>	effects
