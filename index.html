					# Microservices

					3 March 2017

					Dan Hersam

					Note:
					I'm not an expert, just read a few books and this is what I learned.

					## What Are Microservices?
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					> Microservices are small, autonomous services that work together.

 					-- Sam Newman, Thoughtworks
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					> Loosely coupled service-oriented architecture with bounded contexts.

					-- Adrian Cockcroft, Battery Ventures
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					> An independently deployable component of bounded scope that supports interoperability through message-based communication.

					-- Irakli Nadareishvili
				</section>

					## How To Recognize One in the Wild

				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Does One Thing Well

					(Single Responsibility Principle)

					Note:
					Small and Focused
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Autonomous

					Note:
					Must be decoupled from other services and isolated
					Golden rule: can you make a change to a service and deploy it by itself without changing anything else?
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Elastic and Resilient

					Note:
					Scale appropriately depending on the usage
					Fault-tolerant and provide a reasonable recovery timeframe if something goes wrong.
				</section>

					## Compared to a Monolith...

				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Why Use Microservices?
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					### Common Problems

					* Code complexity and maintainability
					* Deployment as a bottleneck
					* Fear to change
					* Lack of ownership
					* Tightly-coupled dependencies
					* One size doesn't fit all
					* Hard to scale out

					Note:
					Go through each one to explain a little about it (on this slide)
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Key Benefits

					* Increased Development Speed
					* Mixed Technology
					* Resilience
					* Scaling
					* Ease of Deployment
					* Composable
					* Organizational Alignment
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Increased Development Speed

					![](images/faster.gif)
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Mixed Technology</h2>

					<img src="images/supercomputer_cyoa_large.jpeg" class="limit-height">

					<aside class="notes">
					Easy to try out the latest technologies with reduced negative impact on the rest of the system
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Resilience</h2>

					<img src="images/christmas-lights.jpg" class="limit-height">

					<aside class="notes">
						Insulates individual services from one another
					</aside>
				</section>

			  <section data-markdown>
					## Scaling

					![](images/monster-tricycle.jpg)
				</section>

			  <section data-markdown>
					## Ease of Deployment

					![](images/indy-deployment.gif)
				</section>

			  <section data-markdown>
					## Composable

					![](images/legos-legot.jpg)
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Organizational Alignment

					![](images/Too_Many_Cooks.png)

					Note:
					Reduce the number of people working on a single codebase
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>...The Two Pizza Rule</h2>

					<img src="images/two-pizzas.jpg" class="limit-height">

					<aside class="notes">
						How to size teams? (Often credited to Jeff Bezos) If a team can't be fed by two pizzas, it's too big.
						Seems odd to make teams based on how much they can eat, but it's a start.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Ready For Production?

					* Netflix
					* Amazon
					* Spotify
					* SoundCloud
					* Uber

				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					# BUT...
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
				  ## Not A Silver Bullet

			  </section>

			  <section>
			  	<!-- For some reason the list turns into a code block with markdown -->
			    <h2>New Concerns</h2>

					<ul>
						<li>Authentication</li>
				    <li>Message Routing</li>
				    <li>Network Delays</li>
				    <li>API Management</li>
				    <li>Service Discovery</li>
				    <li>Debugging</li>
				    <li>Defining Boundaries</li>
				    <li>Decentralization</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						Generally, increased operational complexity, eventual consistency
						Developers must implement the interservice communication mechanism.

						Implementing use cases that span multiple services without using distributed transactions is difficult

						Implementing use cases that span multiple services requires careful coordination between the teams
					</aside>

					## What About SOA?

					Note:
					Service Oriented Architecture at its heart is a very sensible idea - modularity and message-based communication. However much of the conventional wisdom around SOA doesnâ€™t help you understand how to split something big into something small.
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## What About Decomposition?

					* Requires Same Technology
					* Lose Scaling Independently
					* Lose Independent Deployment
					* Less Resiliency

					Note:
					E.g. Modules or Shared Libraries
					Many of the advantages of a microservice-based architecture come from its granular nature and the fact that it gives you many more choices for solving problems. Can similar decompositional techniques achieve the same benefits?
					Technically, it should be possible to create well-factored, independent modules within a single monolithic process. And yet this rarely happens. The modules themselves soon become tightly coupled with the rest of the code, surrendering one of their key benefits. Having a process boundary separation does enforce clean hygiene in this respect (or at least makes it harder to do the wrong thing)

					## Should You Start Using Microservices?

				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Conway's Law

					> Any organization that designs a system will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure.

					-- Mel Conway

				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
				  ## Questions to Ask

				  * How are responsibilities divided between teams?
				  * How are development and operations divided?
				  * How big are the teams?
				  * What skills do they have?
				  * How is power distributed between the teams?
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Other Considerations...
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Sufficiently Large Project

					Note:
					Microservices are ideal for big systems
					Warrants complexity of microservices (they don't come for free)
					Large, distributed team
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Focused on replaceability

					Note:
					Microservices can allow you to be more flexible and swap out components that aren't working well
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Deep Understanding of Problem Domain

					Note:
					One needs to know the problem domain very well before being able to correctly break it down into subdomains small
enough constitute functionalities for microservices.
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Second Version of Existing System

					Note:
					Ideal scenario
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## How To Introduce Change?

					> Find small changes that can unfold in a way that creates large
					>	effects
